### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an analytical and detail-oriented full-stack developer with over 3 years of industry experience. My expertise lies in developing MongoDB, React.js, Node.js (MERN stack), Python, Django, and PHP web applications. I take pride in writing clean code and adhering to software development life cycle (SDLC) best practices, including automated unit testing, component testing, and end-to-end testing within a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.
